          <p>
            Like most website operators, 20sos collects
            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
            and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
            language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
            visitor request. 20sos's purpose in collecting non-personally
            identifying information is to better understand how 20sos's visitors
            use its website. From time to time, 20sos may release
            non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
            publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
          </p>
          <p>
            20sos also collects potentially personally-identifying information
            like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for
            users leaving comments on https://20sos.co.uk blog posts. 20sos only
            discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
            circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
            information as described below.

            Certain visitors to 20sos's websites choose to interact with 20sos
            in ways that require 20sos to gather personally-identifying
            information. The amount and type of information that 20sos gathers
            depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask
            visitors who leave a comment at https://20sos.co.uk to provide a
            username and email address.

            of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use

            we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

            other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will
            be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of

          </h2>
          <p>
            20sos discloses potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
            contractors and affiliated organisations that (i) need to know that
            information in order to process it on 20sos's behalf or to provide
            services available at 20sos's website, and (ii) that have agreed not
            to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
            affiliated organisations may be located outside of your home
            country; by using 20sos's website, you consent to the transfer of
            such information to them. 20sos will not rent or sell potentially
            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
            anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
            organisations, as described above, 20sos discloses potentially
            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only
            in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental
            request, or when 20sos believes in good faith that disclosure is
            reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of 20sos,
            third parties or the public at large.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a registered user of https://20sos.co.uk and have
            supplied your email address, 20sos may occasionally send you an
            email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just
            keep you up to date with what's going on with 20sos and our
            products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of
            information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
            If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one
            of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in
            order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us
            support other users. 20sos takes all measures reasonably necessary
            to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or
            destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information.
